In SVM problem I was facing was liblinear was failing to converge and unable to print k fold accuracy scores when i was puttingh cv=10. I changed the value for cv from 10 to 4 and this solved it but was still getting 50% accuracy. To increase the accuracy I used StandardScalar(). What standard scalar does is it removes the mean value and scales each feature/variable to unit variance. It transform our data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1. Given the distribution of the data, each value in the dataset will have the mean value subtracted, and then divided by the standard deviation of the whole dataset ![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73839879/168486071-c52df4e6-e393-4eb1-9a28-860a2f011d93.PNG)
